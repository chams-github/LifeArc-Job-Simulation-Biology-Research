# Report: Task 1 - Optimizing Neuronal Differentiation Conditions for Nociceptor Neurons

## Overview

In this task, the goal was to optimize the conditions for differentiating neural progenitor cells into nociceptor neurons, which are required for screening novel medicines against chronic pain. Specifically, we aimed to evaluate different treatment conditions to maximize the proportion of neurons expressing **MAP2**, a marker for mature neurons, which serves as an indicator of successful differentiation.

## Experimental Conditions

Two key variables were tested to determine their impact on neuronal differentiation:

- **NGN2 Virus (MOI levels)**: MOI refers to the multiplicity of infection, or the ratio of virus particles to cells. We tested different MOI levels (0, 2, 5, and 10) to see which yielded the highest proportion of MAP2-positive neurons.
- **NT3 Supplement**: A neurotrophic factor used to promote neuronal differentiation. We tested conditions both with and without NT3 to assess its effect on the differentiation process.

## Results

After conducting logistic regression analyses on the experimental data, we identified the following key findings:

- **Optimal NGN2 MOI**: The most effective MOI for maximizing MAP2-positive neurons was found to be **5 MOI**. This dose yielded the highest proportion of mature neurons.
- **Effect of NT3 Supplement**: Adding the NT3 supplement further increased the proportion of MAP2-positive cells, indicating that NT3 enhances neuronal differentiation.

## Conclusion

Based on the analyses performed in this task, the optimal experimental conditions for differentiating neural progenitor cells into mature neurons were determined to be **5 MOI of NGN2 virus** combined with **NT3 supplementation**. These conditions will serve as the baseline for generating nociceptor neurons in subsequent experiments.

Further experiments will focus on assessing the functionality of the differentiated neurons and determining whether these conditions are effective for generating nociceptor-specific neurons.
